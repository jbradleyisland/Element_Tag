**Element Tag** speeds up the process of tagging elements within fabrication tickets by separating them into families, types, and lengths to generate unique IDs and then apply those IDs as tags in the view.

* Once inside the view you'd like elements tagged in, run the **Element Tag** script. The script will then parse through the elements inside of the view based on family category and assign IDs and generate tags within the view.
